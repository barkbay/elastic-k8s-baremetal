# Configuration

The majority of the configuration is handled through an Ansible inventory
directory. A sample inventory can be found at
`openshift-ansible/playbooks/openstack/sample-inventory/`.

`inventory/group_vars/all.yml` is used for OpenStack configuration,
while `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml` is used for OpenShift
configuration.

Environment variables may also be used.

## OpenStack Configuration

In `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

* `openshift_openstack_keypair_name` OpenStack keypair to use.
* Role Node Counts
  * `openshift_openstack_num_masters` Number of master nodes to create.
  * `openshift_openstack_num_infra` Number of infra nodes to create.
  * `openshift_openstack_num_nodes` Number of app nodes to create.
* Role Images
  * `openshift_openstack_default_image_name` OpenStack image used by all VMs, unless a particular role image name is specified.
  * `openshift_openstack_master_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_infra_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_cns_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_node_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_lb_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_etcd_image_name`
* Role Flavors
  * `openshift_openstack_default_flavor` OpenStack flavor used by all VMs, unless a particular role flavor name is specified.
  * `openshift_openstack_master_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_infra_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_cns_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_node_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_lb_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_etcd_flavor`
* Role Hostnames: used for customizing public names of Nova servers provisioned with a given role.
  * `openshift_openstack_master_hostname` Defaults to `master`.
  * `openshift_openstack_infra_hostname` Defaults to `infra-node`.
  * `openshift_openstack_cns_hostname` Defaults to `cns`.
  * `openshift_openstack_node_hostname` Defaults to `app-node`.
  * `openshift_openstack_lb_hostname` Defaults to `lb`.
  * `openshift_openstack_etcd_hostname` Defaults to `etcd`.
* `openshift_openstack_external_network_name` OpenStack network providing external connectivity.
* `openshift_openstack_provision_user_commands` Allows users to execute shell commands via cloud-init for all of the created Nova servers in the Heat stack, before they are available for SSH connections. Note that you should use [custom Ansible playbooks](./post-install.md#run-custom-post-provision-actions) whenever possible. User specified shell commands for cloud-init need to be either strings or lists:

```
- openshift_openstack_provision_user_commands:
  - set -vx
  - systemctl stop sshd # fences off ansible playbooks as we want to reboot later
  - ['echo', 'foo', '>', '/tmp/foo']
  - [ ls, /tmp/foo, '||', true ]
  - reboot # unfences ansible playbooks to continue after reboot
```

* `openshift_openstack_nodes_to_remove` The numerical indexes of app nodes that should be removed; for example, `['0', '2']`,
* Role Docker Volume Size
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_volume_size` Default Docker volume size used by all VMs, unless a particular role Docker volume size is specified. If `openshift_openstack_ephemeral_volumes` is set to `true`, the `*_volume_size` variables will be ignored and the deployment will not create any cinder volumes.
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_master_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_infra_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_cns_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_node_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_etcd_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_lb_volume_size`
* `openshift_openstack_flat_secgrp` Set to True if you experience issues with sec group rules quotas. It trades security for number of rules, by sharing the same set of firewall rules for master, node, etcd and infra nodes.
* `openshift_openstack_required_packages` List of additional prerequisite packages to be installed before deploying an OpenShift cluster.
* `openshift_openstack_heat_template_version` Defaults to `pike`


## OpenShift Configuration

In `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`:

* `openshift_disable_check` List of checks to disable.
* `openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname` Custom entrypoint; for example, `api.openshift.example.com`. Note than an empty hostname does not work, so if your domain is `openshift.example.com` you cannot set this value to simply `openshift.example.com`.
* `openshift_deployment_type` Version of OpenShift to deploy; for example, `origin` or `openshift-enterprise`
* `openshift_master_default_subdomain`

Additional options can be found in this sample inventory:

https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/inventory/hosts.example


## Stack Name Configuration

By default the Heat stack created by OpenStack for the OpenShift cluster will be
named `openshift-cluster`. If you would like to use a different name then you
must set the `OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER` environment variable before running the playbooks:

```
$ export OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER=openshift.example.com
```

If you use a non-default stack name and run the openshift-ansible playbooks to update
your deployment, you must set `OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER` to your stack name to avoid errors.


## DNS Configuration

OpenStack deployments require an external DNS server for now. This
server must be able to resolve the the OpenShift node names to their
internal IP addresses.

We will be looking into using the internal Neutron DNS and/or the
Designate project in the future.

While we do not create a DNS for you, if it supports nsupdate (RFC
2136[nsupdate-rfc]), we can populate it with the cluster records
automatically.

[nsupdate-rfc]: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2136.txt

### OpenShift Cluster Domain

To set up the domain name of your OpenShift cluster, set these
parameters in `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

* `openshift_openstack_clusterid` Defaults to `openshift`
* `openshift_openstack_public_dns_domain` Defaults to `example.com`

Together, they form the cluster's public DNS domain that all the
servers will be under; by default this domain will be
`openshift.example.com`.

They're split so you can deploy multiple clusters under the same
domain with a single inventory change: e.g. `testing.example.com` and
`production.example.com`.

You will also want to put the IP addresses of your DNS server(s) in
the `openshift_openstack_dns_nameservers` array in the same file.

This will configure the Neutron subnet with all the OpenShift nodes to forward
to these DNS servers. Which means that any server running in that subnet will
use the DNS automatically, without any extra configuration.


### Adding the DNS Records Automatically

If your DNS supports nsupdate, you can set up the
`openshift_openstack_external_nsupdate_keys` variable and all the
necessary DNS records will be added during the provisioning phase
(after the OpenShift nodes are created, but before we install anything
on them).

Add this to your `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

```
    openshift_openstack_external_nsupdate_keys:
      private:
        key_secret: <some nsupdate key>
        key_algorithm: 'hmac-md5'
        key_name: 'update-key'
        server: <private DNS server IP>
```

Make sure that all four values (key secret, algorithm, key name and
the DNS IP address) are correct.

This will create the records for the internal OpenShift communication.
If you also want public records for external access, add another
section called `public` with the same structure.

If you want to use the same DNS server for both public and private
records, you must set at least one of:

* `openshift_openstack_public_hostname_suffix` Empty by default.
* `openshift_openstack_private_hostname_suffix` Empty by default.

Otherwise the private records will be overwritten by the public ones.

For example by leaving the *private* suffix empty and setting the *public* one
to:

```
openshift_openstack_public_hostname_suffix: -public
```

The internal access to the first master node would be available with:
`master-0.openshift.example.com`, while the public access using the floating IP
address would be under `master-0-public.openshift.example.com`.

Note that these suffixes are only applied to the OpenShift Node names
as they appear in the DNS. They will not affect the actual hostnames.

It is recommended that you use two separate servers for the private
and public access instead.

If your nsupdate zone differs from the full OpenShift DNS name (e.g.
your DNS' zone is "example.com" but you want your cluster to be at
"openshift.example.com"), you can specify the zone in this parameter:

* `openshift_openstack_nsupdate_zone: example.com`

If left out, it will be equal to the OpenShift cluster DNS.

Don't forget to put your the internal (private) DNS servers to the
`openshift_openstack_dns_nameservers` array.


### Custom DNS Records Configuration

If you're unable (or do not want) to use nsupdate, you will have to
create your DNS records out-of-band.

To do that, you will have to split the deployment into three phases:

1. Provision (creates the OpenShift servers)
2. Create DNS records (this is your responsibility)
3. Installation (installs OpenShift on the servers)

To do this, run the `provision.yml` and `install.yml` playbooks
instead of the all-in-one `provision_install.yml` and add your DNS
records between the runs.

You still need to set the `openshift_openstack_dns_nameservers` with
your (private/internal) DNS servers in `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`.

Next, you need to create a DNS record for every OpenShift node that
was created. This record must point to the node's **private** IP
address (not the floating IP).

You can see the server names and their private floating IP addresses
by running `openstack server list`.

For example with the following output:

```
$ openstack server list
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
| ID                                   | Name                                 | Status  | Networks                                                                   | Image   | Flavor    |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
| 8445bd74-aaf1-4c54-b6fe-e98efa6e47de | master-0.openshift.example.com     | ACTIVE  | openshift-ansible-openshift.example.com-net=192.168.99.10, 10.40.128.136 | centos7 | m1.medium |
| 635f0a24-bde7-488d-aa0d-c31e0a01e7c4 | infra-node-0.openshift.example.com | ACTIVE  | openshift-ansible-openshift.example.com-net=192.168.99.4, 10.40.128.130  | centos7 | m1.medium |
| 04657a99-29b1-48c8-8979-3c88ee1c1615 | app-node-0.openshift.example.com   | ACTIVE  | openshift-ansible-openshift.example.com-net=192.168.99.6, 10.40.128.132  | centos7 | m1.medium |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
```

You will need to create these A records:

```
master-0.openshift.cool.       192.168.99.10
infra-node-0.openshift.cool.   192.168.99.4
app-node-0.openshift.cool.     192.168.99.16
```

For the public access, you'll need to create 2 records: one for the
API access and the other for the OpenShift apps running on the
cluster.

```
console.openshift.cool.    10.40.128.137
*.apps.openshift.cool.     10.40.128.129
```

These must point to the publicly-accessible IP addresses of your
master and infra nodes or preferably to the load balancers.


## All-in-one Deployment Configuration

If you want to deploy OpenShift on a single node (e.g. for quick evaluation),
you can do so with a few configuration changes.

First, set the node counts and labels like so in
`inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

```
openshift_openstack_num_masters: 1
openshift_openstack_num_infra: 0
openshift_openstack_num_nodes: 0

openshift_openstack_master_group_name: node-config-all-in-one
```

Next, define the `node-config-all-in-one` group in `OSEv3.yml`:

```
openshift_node_groups:
- name: node-config-all-in-one
  labels:
  - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true'
  - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=true'
  - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true'
```

Then run the deployment playbooks as usual. At the end, you will have an
OpenShift running on a single OpenStack VM.

The options here define a new OpenShift node group that has the labels for all
three roles: master, infra and compute. And we create a single node and assign
this new group to it.

Note that the "all in one" node must be the "master". openshift-ansible
expects at least one node in the `masters` Ansible group.


## Building Node Images

It is possible to build the OpenShift images in advance (instead of installing
the dependencies during the deployment). This will reduce the disk and network
throughput as well as speed up the installation.

To do this, the inventory must already exist and be configured.

Set the `openshift_openstack_default_image_name` value in
`inventory/group_vars/all.yml` to a name you want this new image to be called
(e.g. `origin-node`). This name must not exist in OpenStack yet.

Next, set `openshift_openstack_build_base_image` to a name of an *existing*
image that you want to use as a base. This should be the cloud image you would
normally use for the deployment.

And finally, run the `build_image.yml` playbook:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory openshift-ansible/playbooks/openstack/openshift-cluster/build_image.yml

This will create a temporary Neutron network, subnet and router, launch a
server in that subnet, install all the packages and pull the necessary
container images and upload an image with the name set in
`openshift_openstack_default_image_name`.

All the extra OpenStack resources (network, subnet, router) will then be
deleted.

Note that the subnet's CIDR will be `192.168.23.0/24`. If you need to use a
different value, set `openshift_openstack_build_network_cidr` before running
the `build_image` playbook.

If you don't want to be setting the build variables in your inventory, you can
pass them to ansible-playbook directly:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory openshift-ansible/playbooks/openstack/openshift-cluster/build_image.yml -e openshift_openstack_build_base_image=CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1805 -e openshift_openstack_build_network_cidr=192.168.42.0/24


## Kuryr Networking Configuration

Kuryr is an SDN that uses OpenStack Neutron. This prevents the double overlay
overhead one would get when running OpenShift on OpenStack using the default
OpenShift SDN.

https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr-kubernetes/latest/readme.html

### OpenStack Requirements

Kuryr has a few additional requirements on the underlying OpenStack deployment:

* The Trunk Ports extension must be enabled:
  * https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/pike/admin/config-trunking.html
  * Make sure to restart `neutron-server` after you change the configuration
* Neutron must use the Open vSwitch firewall driver:
  * https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/pike/admin/config-ovsfwdriver.html
  * Make sure to restart `neutron-openvswitch-agent` after the config change
* A Load Balancer as a Service (implementing LBaaS v2 API) must be available
  * Octavia is the only supported solution right now
  * You could try the native Neutron LBaaSv2 but it is deprecated and buggy

We recommend you use the Queens or newer release of OpenStack.


### Necessary Kuryr Options

This is the minimum you need to set (in `group_vars/all.yml`):

```yaml
openshift_use_kuryr: true
openshift_use_openshift_sdn: false
os_sdn_network_plugin_name: cni
openshift_node_proxy_mode: userspace
openshift_hosted_manage_registry: false
use_trunk_ports: true

openshift_master_open_ports:
- service: dns tcp
  port: 53/tcp
- service: dns udp
  port: 53/udp
openshift_node_open_ports:
- service: dns tcp
  port: 53/tcp
- service: dns udp
  port: 53/udp

kuryr_openstack_public_net_id: <public/external net UUID>
```

The `kuryr_openstack_public_net_id` value must be set to the UUID of the
public net in your OpenStack. In other words, the net with the Floating
IP range defined. It corresponds to the public network, which is often called
`public`, `external` or `ext-net`.

Additionally, if the public net has different subnet, you can specify the
specific one with `kuryr_openstack_public_subnet_id`, whose value must be set
to the UUID of the public subnet in your OpenStack.

**NOTE**: A lot of OpenStack deployments do not make the public subnet
accessible to regular users.

### Port pooling

It is possible to pre-create Neutron ports for later use. This means that
several ports (each port will be attached to an OpenShift pod) would be created
at once. This will speed up individual pod creation at the cost of having a few
extra ports that are not currently in use.

For more information on the Kuryr port pools, check out the Kuryr
documentation:

https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr-kubernetes/latest/installation/ports-pool.html

You can control the port pooling characteristics with these options:

```yaml
kuryr_openstack_pool_max: 0
kuryr_openstack_pool_min: 1
kuryr_openstack_pool_batch: 5
kuryr_openstack_pool_update_frequency: 20
`openshift_kuryr_precreate_subports: 5`
```

Note in the last variable you specify the number of subports that will
be created per trunk port, i.e., per pool.

You need to set the pool driver you want to use, depending on the target
environment, i.e., neutron for baremetal deployments or nested for deployments
on top of VMs:

```yaml
kuryr_openstack_pool_driver: neutron
kuryr_openstack_pool_driver: nested
```

And to disable this feature, you must set:

```yaml
kuryr_openstack_pool_driver: noop
```

On the other hand, there is a multi driver support to enable hybrid
deployments with different pools drivers. In order to enable the kuryr
`multi-pool` driver support, we need to also tag the nodes with their
corresponding `pod_vif` labels so that the right kuryr pool driver is used
for each VM/node.

To do that, set this in `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`:

```yaml
kuryr_openstack_pool_driver: multi

openshift_node_groups:
  - name: node-config-master
    labels:
      - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true'
    edits: []
  - name: node-config-infra
    labels:
      - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=true'
      - 'pod_vif=nested-vlan'
    edits: []
  - name: node-config-compute
    labels:
      - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true'
      - 'pod_vif=nested-vlan'
    edits: []
```


### Namespace Subnet driver

By default, kuryr is configured with the default subnet driver where all the
pods are deployed on the same Neutron subnet. However, there is an option of
enabling a different subnet driver, named namespace, which makes pods to be
allocated on different subnets depending on the namespace they belong to. To
enable this new kuryr subnet driver you need to uncomment:

```yaml
openshift_kuryr_subnet_driver: namespace
```


### Deploying OpenShift Registry

Since we've disabled the OpenShift registry creation, you will have to create
it manually afterwards. SSH to a master node and run this as root:

```yaml
oadm registry --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig --service-account=registry
```

For more information (e.g. how to use a specific storage backend), please
follow the OpenShift documentation on the registry:

https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/registry/index.html


### Kuryr Controller and CNI healthchecks probes

By default kuryr controller and cni pods are deployed with readiness and
liveness probes enabled. To disable them you can just uncomment:

```yaml
enable_kuryr_controller_probes: True
enable_kuryr_cni_probes: True
```


## API and Router Load Balancing

A production deployment should contain more then one master and infra node and
have a load balancer in front of them.

The playbooks will not create any load balancer by default. Even if you do
request multiple masters.

You can opt into that if you want though. There are two options: a VM-based
load balancer and OpenStack's Load Balancer as a Service.

### Load Balancer as a Service

If your OpenStack supports Load Balancer as a Service (LBaaS) provided by the
Octavia project, our playbooks can set it up automatically.

Put this in your `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

    openshift_openstack_use_lbaas_load_balancer: true

This will create two load balancers: one for the API and UI console and the
other for the OpenShift router. Each will have its own public IP address.

This playbook defaults to using OpenStack Octavia as its LBaaSv2 provider:

    openshift_openstack_lbaasv2_provider: Octavia

If your cloud uses the deprecated Neutron LBaaSv2 provider set:

    openshift_openstack_lbaasv2_provider: "Neutron::LBaaS"

### VM-based Load Balancer

If you can't use OpenStack's LBaaS, we can create and configure a virtual
machine running HAProxy to serve as one.

Put this in your `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

    openshift_openstack_use_vm_load_balancer: true

**WARNING** this VM will only handle the API and UI requests, *not* the
OpenShift routes.

That means, if you have more than one infra node, you will have to balance them
externally. It is not recommended to use this option in production.

### No Load Balancer

If you specify neither `openshift_openstack_use_lbaas_load_balancer` nor
`openshift_openstack_use_vm_load_balancer`, the resulting OpenShift cluster
will have no load balancing configured out of the box.

This is regardless of how many master or infra nodes you create.

In this mode, you are expected to configure and maintain a load balancer
yourself.

However, the cluster is usable without a load balancer as well. To talk to the
API or UI, connect to any of the master nodes. For the OpenShift routes, use
any of the infra nodes.

### Public Cluster Endpoints

In either of these cases (LBaaS, VM HAProxy, no LB) the public addresses to
access the cluster's API and router will be printed out at the end of the
playbook.

If you want to get them out explicitly, run the following playbook with the
same arguments (private key, inventories, etc.) as your provision/install ones:

    playbooks/openstack/inventory.py openshift-ansible/playbooks/openstack/openshift-cluster/cluster-info.yml

These addresses will depend on the load balancing solution. For LBaaS, they'll
be the the floating IPs of the load balancers. In the VM-based solution,
the API address will be the public IP of the load balancer VM and the router IP
will be the address of the first infra node that was created. If no load
balancer is selected, the API will be the address of the first master node and
the router will be the address of the first infra node.

This means that regardless of the load balancing solution, you can use these
two entries to provide access to your cluster.



## Provider Network Configuration

Normally, the playbooks create a new Neutron network and subnet and attach
floating IP addresses to each node. If you have a provider network set up, this
is all unnecessary as you can just access servers that are placed in the
provider network directly.

Note that this will not update the nodes' DNS, so running openshift-ansible
right after provisioning will fail (unless you're using an external DNS server
your provider network knows about). You must make sure your nodes are able to
resolve each other by name.

In `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

* `openshift_openstack_provider_network_name` Provider network name. Setting this will cause the `openshift_openstack_external_network_name` and `openshift_openstack_private_network_name` parameters to be ignored.


## OpenStack Credential Configuration

Some features require you to configure OpenStack credentials. In `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`:

* `openshift_cloudprovider_kind: openstack
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_auth_url: "{{ lookup('env','OS_AUTH_URL') }}"
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_username: "{{ lookup('env','OS_USERNAME') }}"
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_password: "{{ lookup('env','OS_PASSWORD') }}"
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_tenant_name: "{{ lookup('env','OS_PROJECT_NAME') }}"
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_domain_name: "{{ lookup('env','OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME') }}"

For more information, consult the [Configuring for OpenStack page in the OpenShift documentation][openstack-credentials].

[openstack-credentials]: https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/configuring_openstack.html#install-config-configuring-openstack

**NOTE** the OpenStack integration currently requires DNS to be configured and
running and the `openshift_hostname` variable must match the Nova server name
for each node. The cluster deployment will fail without it. If you use the
provided OpenStack dynamic inventory and configure the
`openshift_openstack_dns_nameservers` Ansible variable, this will be handled
for you.


## Cinder-Backed Persistent Volumes Configuration

In addition to [setting up OpenStack credentials](#openstack-credential-configuration),
you must set the following in `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`:

* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_blockstorage_version`: v2

The Block Storage version must be set to `v2`, because OpenShift does not support
the v3 API yet and the version detection currently does not work.

After a successful deployment, the cluster will be configured for Cinder persistent
volumes.

### Validation

1. Log in and create a new project (with `oc login` and `oc new-project`)
2. Create a file called `cinder-claim.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolumeClaim"
metadata:
  name: "claim1"
spec:
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: "1Gi"
```
3. Run `oc create -f cinder-claim.yaml` to create the Persistent Volume Claim object in OpenShift
4. Run `oc describe pvc claim1` to verify that the claim was created and its Status is `Bound`
5. Run `openstack volume list`
   * A new volume called `kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-UUID` should be created
   * Its size should be `1`
   * It should not be attached to any server
6. Create a file called `mysql-pod.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    name: mysql
spec:
  containers:
    - resources:

7. Run `oc create -f mysql-pod.yaml` to create the pod
8. Run `oc describe pod mysql`
   * Its events should show that the pod has successfully attached the volume above
   * It should show no errors
   * `openstack volume list` should show the volume attached to an OpenShift app node
   * NOTE: this can take several seconds
9. After a while, `oc get pod` should show the `mysql` pod as running
10. Run `oc delete pod mysql` to remove the pod
   * The Cinder volume should no longer be attached
11. Run `oc delete pvc claim1` to remove the volume claim
   * The Cinder volume should be deleted


## Cinder-Backed Registry Configuration

You can use a pre-existing Cinder volume for the storage of your
OpenShift registry. To do that, you need to have a Cinder volume.
You can create one by running:

```
openstack volume create --size <volume size in gb> <volume name>
```

Alternatively, the playbooks can create the volume created automatically if you
specify its name and size.

In either case, you have to [set up OpenStack
credentials](#openstack-credential-configuration), and then set the following
in `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`:

* `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_kind`: openstack
* `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_access_modes`: ['ReadWriteOnce']
* `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_openstack_filesystem`: xfs
* `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_volume_size`: 10Gi

For a volume *you created*, you must also specify its **UUID** (it must be
the UUID, not the volume's name):

```
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_openstack_volumeID: e0ba2d73-d2f9-4514-a3b2-a0ced507fa05
```

If you want the volume *created automatically*, set the desired name instead:

```
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_volume_name: registry
```

The volume will be formatted automaticaly and it will be mounted to one of the
infra nodes when the registry pod gets started.


## Deploying At Scale

By default, heat stack outputs are resolved.  This may cause
problems in large scale deployments.  Querying heat stack can take
a long time and eventually time out.  The following setting in
`inventory/group_vars/all.yml` is recommended to prevent the timeouts:

* `openshift_openstack_resolve_heat_outputs`: False
